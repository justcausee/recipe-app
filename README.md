# recipe-app

recipe-app is an app where you can find recipes to cook at home. I named the app "Nothing Beets Our Recipes" as sort of a pun for beets, which is a purple herbaceous plant, a common source of food in some areas and livestock. Since I decided to go with this pun, I have created a color set choices of white, purple, and green.

## How to use the APP

To use the app, head onto the website and decide on what recipe you may be interested in. There are only a few recipes for you to look over but you may add, edit, or remove recipes as well. Feel free to look around!

## Troubles/bugs addressed

Unfortunately, there were many challenges in working with my group so I had to complete this project on my own with very limited time given. Many features were not implemented as I'd hoped, such as a favorited section, filtered lists, and some CSS designing. I managed to get the database to function normally which took a lot of time since there were so many bugs to address. I tried adding our own custom logo into navigation bar but the images wouldn't load properly. I believe it was because a lot of the data run through the Handlebars template, which caused complications. Since this was the case, I had to abandon my personal frontend side (frontend folder) of the project and implement as much characteristics directly from there instead. The "backend" folder includes all frontend and backend development but feel free to look at what I had originally planned for the website to look like by opening the index.html file in the "frontend" folder. Also, since there's no API working for this project, there's very little database to work navigate your way through, sadly. I hope to improve this project later on so I can add onto my portfolio.

## Inspirations

I love food! Sharing recipes from all of the world and sharing our own culture has always a long passion of mine!
