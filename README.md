# recipe-app

recipe-app is an app where you can find recipes to cook at home. We named the app "Nothing Beets Our Recipes" as sort of a pun for beets, which is a purple herbaceous plant, a common source of food in some areas and livestock. Since we decided to go with this pun, we have created a custom logo with a unique color set choices of white, purple, and green.

## System Components

Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend - Node.JS

## Commands (how to launch frontend, backend, etc.)

Make sure Express is installed by using the command 'npm install express'
The server can be launched with the "node app.js" in the server folder.
The frontend can be launched on a local machine from localhost on port 3001.

## How to use the APP

To use the app, head onto the website and decide on what recipe you may be interested in. There are different categories where you can select the most popular recipes or even the holiday special ones. Choose wisely. And then go ahead and click on a recipe and a complete description of the ingredients and how to prepare the dish would be provided. Wah la!

## Bugs/addresses

There's no functionality just yet at the time of this README file. The issue we're facing right now is connecting the backend with the frontend. However, the styling and the links are still up. This will essentially give you an idea of what a fully functional website should look like.

## Inspirations

We love food! Sharing recipes from all of the world and sharing our own culture has always been our passion.
